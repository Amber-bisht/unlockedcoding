# Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Implementation

This project now includes SSR for the home page (`/` route) to improve SEO and initial page load performance.

## How it works

### 1. Server-Side Rendering
- When a user visits the home page (`/`), the server pre-fetches categories data from the database
- The React component is rendered to HTML on the server using `react-dom/server`
- The rendered HTML is sent to the client with pre-fetched data embedded

### 2. Client-Side Hydration
- The client receives the pre-rendered HTML and dehydrated state
- React Query is hydrated with the server data to avoid refetching
- The app becomes interactive without additional API calls

### 3. SEO Benefits
- Search engines see fully rendered content immediately
- Meta tags and structured data are included in the initial HTML
- Social media sharing shows proper previews

## Files Modified

### Server-side
- `server/ssr.ts` - SSR rendering logic and HTML template
- `server/vite.ts` - Updated to handle SSR for home page route
- `server/index.ts` - No changes needed

### Client-side
- `client/src/main.tsx` - Updated to handle hydration
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Added HydrationBoundary for React Query

## Development vs Production

### Development
- SSR is handled in the Vite middleware
- Hot reload still works for other routes
- SSR errors fall back to client-side rendering

### Production
- SSR is handled in the Express static file serving
- Pre-built client files are served
- SSR errors fall back to static index.html

## Performance Benefits

1. **Faster Initial Load**: Users see content immediately without waiting for API calls
2. **Better SEO**: Search engines can crawl the full content
3. **Improved Core Web Vitals**: Better LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) scores
4. **Social Media Sharing**: Proper Open Graph and Twitter Card previews

## Monitoring

The SSR process includes console logging to help debug issues:
- "Starting SSR for home page..."
- "Pre-fetching categories data..."
- "Fetched X categories for SSR"
- "Component rendered successfully"
- "Dehydrated state prepared"

## Error Handling

If SSR fails for any reason:
1. The error is logged to the console
2. The server falls back to client-side rendering
3. Users still get a functional page

## Future Enhancements

- Add SSR for other important pages (categories, course details)
- Implement caching for SSR results
- Add streaming SSR for better performance
- Implement incremental static regeneration (ISR)
