## API Endpoints

### Get Featured Testimonials
```
GET /api/testimonials/featured
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "testimonial_id",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
    "role": "Web Development Graduate",
    "content": "Amazing learning experience!",
    "rating": 5,
    "courseTitle": "Full Stack Web Development",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
]
```

### Get All Testimonials (with pagination)
```
GET /api/testimonials?page=1&limit=10
```

## Database Schema

The testimonials use the existing `Review` model with the following structure:

```typescript
interface IReview {
  userId: ObjectId;        // Reference to User
  courseId: ObjectId;      // Reference to Course
  rating: number;          // 1-5 star rating
  comment: string;         // Testimonial text
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## SSR Integration

The testimonials are included in the server-side rendering process:

1. **Pre-fetching**: Categories and testimonials are fetched during SSR
2. **Hydration**: Data is passed to the client for seamless hydration
3. **Performance**: No additional API calls needed on initial load

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Seed Sample Data
```bash
npm run db:seed-testimonials
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. View Results
Visit the home page to see dynamic testimonials in action.

## Customization

### Modify Testimonial Display
Edit `client/src/pages/home-page.tsx` to change:
- Number of testimonials shown
- Layout and styling
- Loading states

### Adjust Filtering Logic
Edit `server/controllers/testimonials.controller.ts` to modify:
- Rating threshold (currently 4+ stars)
- Sorting criteria

### Update Data Transformation
